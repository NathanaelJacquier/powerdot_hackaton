# powerdot_hackaton
Coding competition hosted at CentraleSup√©lec in collaboration with Powerdot. I worked with @Gauthier.Beranger

The challenge was organized by Powerdot, a European company specializing in the deployment and management of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. Our objective was twofold: first, to develop an optimization algorithm that determines the optimal contracted power level for EV charging stations, balancing cost and capacity; and second, to build a framework for monitoring energy leakage across the network, with the ability to detect and localize anomalies or inefficiencies in energy usage.

This project combined elements of operations research, time-series analysis, and anomaly detection, requiring both technical precision and practical understanding of energy systems.
